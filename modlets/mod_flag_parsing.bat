rem This script parses "flags"
rem Basically everytime you indicate a flag e.g. "/flagname" or "-flagname" followed by a value it sets flag_flagname to the value(s) after it
rem By default " (double quotes) are removed from the values; however, if you would like to include them (or a value that starts with "/" or "-"), you can use the ":" syntax to declare it
rem The ":" syntax is uesd by putting ":" after the flag and then the value e.g. "/flagname:value" 
rem Note that all " (double quotes) will be kept in all values after the ":" until a new flag is declared
rem If the flag doesn't have anything after it or has another flag, the script looks if the second character of that flag was "-" e.g. "/-flagname" or "--flagname"
rem it then sets flag_flagname to "true" or "false" if it lacks or contains "-" respectively
rem Values input without an explicit flag are implicitly added to flag_default, so be aware that it's value will become "true" if the first argument is a flag
